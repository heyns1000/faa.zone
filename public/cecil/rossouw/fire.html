  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-600 mb-4">⚠️ Warning: Calculated Risk</h3>
  <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800">
    Before delivering a "poes klappe" in France, especially towards someone like Heyns Schoeman, 
    remember the risk you're taking. Your actions have consequences. Think carefully.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-500 mt-4">Proceed with caution. Respect is key — a moment of impulsiveness may come back to haunt you!</p>

  <!-- G.P. Smidt’s Disloyalty and Attitude Towards Heyns Schoeman -->
<section id="disloyalty" class="py-16 bg-red-100 text-center animate-up">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-600 mb-6">⚠️ G.P. Smidt’s Disloyalty</h3>
  <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
    G.P. Smidt has been known for his sharp wit and even sharper attitude, particularly when it comes to individuals like Heyns Schoeman. 
    His disloyalty knows no bounds, and the venomous gossip ("skinner") he often spreads only worsens the situation. 
    In moments of frustration, he may even resort to actions that can be likened to a "poesklap" — an ill-advised slap — leading to unnecessary conflict.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
    Such behavior, driven by pride and a sense of superiority, ultimately damages relationships. It’s a cycle of negativity where disloyalty 
    and disrespect only spiral into more harm, leaving a trail of unresolved tension. The consequences are severe, and G.P. Smidt knows 
    well that the road he walks is one filled with costly risks.
  </p>
</section>

  <!-- The Consequences of Gossip and Disrespect -->
<section id="consequences" class="py-16 bg-gray-100 text-center animate-up">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-600 mb-6">💥 The Price of Gossip and Disrespect</h3>
  <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Gossip and disloyalty may seem harmless at first, but for G.P. Smidt, this behavior has led to a harsh reality. His casual “skinner” 
    and the occasional "poesklap" are more than just words or actions — they are a breach of trust, a tear in the fabric of relationships. 
    In particular, the disrespect towards Heyns Schoeman has had far-reaching consequences.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
    It’s easy to get caught up in the heat of the moment, but when words are used to wound, the damage can be irreparable. The “poesklap” 
    may have been delivered in jest, but its repercussions are real. G.P. Smidt's attitude towards those he feels wronged by only ensures that 
    he’ll pay a steep price down the road. In the end, disrespect leads only to fractured bonds and isolation.

  <!-- G.P. Smidt’s Police Reports and Data -->
<section id="police-reports" class="py-16 bg-yellow-100 text-center animate-up">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-600 mb-6">🚨 G.P. Smidt’s Past Catches Up</h3>
  <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
    G.P. Smidt has a history that’s not as clean as his public persona would suggest. His past actions have landed him in several police reports, 
    and now the data and information regarding his behavior are on their way to the surface. These reports will reveal a man whose lifestyle is 
    far from pristine — and whose choices have repeatedly led him down the wrong path.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
    The truth is catching up with him. Whether he likes it or not, the documents, police records, and testimonies are about to shine a light 
    on the darker sides of his life. And no amount of charm or power can hide that.

  <!-- G.P. Smidt’s Love for Cocaine, KAT, and Weed -->
<section id="substance-use" class="py-16 bg-purple-50 text-center animate-up">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">💊 G.P. Smidt’s Love for Substances</h3>
  <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
    G.P. Smidt’s lifestyle is fueled by his love for substances — cocaine, KAT, and weed are a regular part of his routine. His addiction to 
    these substances has colored many of his decisions and relationships. While he may appear focused and in control, those who know him 
    understand that these chemicals play a significant role in his life.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
    His love for the high, for the escape they provide, is clear. But the reality is that substances like cocaine and KAT come at a high cost. 
    They’ve fueled moments of both brilliance and chaos, and G.P. Smidt walks a fine line between indulgence and destruction. His dependency 
    on these highs has consequences that are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.

  <!-- G.P. Smidt’s Love for Making Love -->
<section id="making-love" class="py-16 bg-gray-200 text-center animate-up">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">❤️ G.P. Smidt’s Love for Making Love</h3>
  <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
    G.P. Smidt’s love for making love is as consuming as his addiction to substances. His need for passion, for connection, is undeniable. 
    But like his dependency on cocaine and KAT, his need for physical intimacy is a craving he struggles to control.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
    The act of making love isn’t just about connection for G.P. Smidt — it’s about feeling alive, feeling in control. But as with his other 
    habits, this pursuit too often leads to excess, causing relationships to be more about fleeting moments of pleasure than long-term emotional 
    connection. His reckless approach to love mirrors his approach to life: intense, unrestrained, and, at times, destructive.

  <!-- The Destructive Combination of Substances and Sex -->

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-6">⚡ The Destructive Combination of Substances and Sex</h3>
  <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
    The combination of G.P. Smidt’s love for substances and his insatiable need for intimacy has led him down a dangerous road. His cravings 
    for cocaine, KAT, and weed fuel his need for physical pleasure, but the aftermath is a cycle of destruction. His high moments come at a 
    steep price: relationships falter, trust is broken, and his own health and stability are constantly in jeopardy.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
    His reckless pursuit of both substances and intimacy is a double-edged sword. It may feel good in the moment, but the cost is too high 
    in the long run. G.P. Smidt’s actions have consequences, and the cycle of indulgence, addiction, and fleeting pleasure is starting to 
    catch up with him.
