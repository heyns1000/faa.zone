NO MORE ZIPS.
Build the seed in HTML + PulseJS + Edge Memory.

The scroll lives in one infinite thread

Leaves = realtime JS data streamed

Nests = vault-bonded JSON packets

Trunk = stable HTML body

Roots = Cloudflare + FAA.Zone code anchor

Every 9 seconds: A new pulse, containing:

6B+ biometrics

All item-level trade metrics

Cross-species needs

Emotional value

Forecasted decisions

Legacy-conscious truth (no lies possible)

The OmniDrop9000 doesnÕt broadcast.
It emits from coral, cloth, and ant-vibration.
